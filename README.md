# Golf-Trader

## Description

Golf-Trader is a e-marketplace application designed to allow users to sell, buy and trade golf clubs. Users can use create accounts using OAuth2 with the google strategy so that they access to their listings and messages.

## Technologies
The application is made using the MEN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) stack. 


## Getting started
The application is live at https://golf-trader.fly.dev/home 
Feature Trello board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/hWmUzYoA/planning-project-2


## Future improvements
Currently there is no way for a user to search for a specific club or use filters to search through types of clubs. This functionality is important for any e-marketplace and is in the development pipeline. 

As of now you can only add one image per club, I would like to increase this number and also implement some kind of image compression to save space in the database and improve load times.
